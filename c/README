Introduction
==============

Personal simple data structures implementation in ansi-c.

What included
==============

* list(double link list), general implementation and an improved list
  class to simulate c++.

* sequence stack only

* binary tree only

How to build
=============

General
-------------

Now it's support GNUmake and Cmake both, but out-of-source Cmake is more
suggested.  You can shoose 'Unix Makefiles' or 'MinGW Makefiles' as
well.

Build Steps
-------------

* Cmake cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make all

        or cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" && make all

        Of course, you should in build directory(you should make it
        first) and use out-of-source building it.

* GNUmake make all

Enjoy yourself.
